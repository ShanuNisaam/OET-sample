                        <h5>OET Score Interpretation:</h5>
                        <p>There are four main parts for OET exam to assess the
                            English language proficiency of the test taker,
                            this includes reading, writing, speaking, and
                            listening. OET scorecard depicts the results on a
                            scale of 0-500 for each session with respective
                            grade letter( usually from A to E) provided on a
                            scale. But the overall OET grade is not specified in
                            the scorecard, So it is onto the candidates to
                            analyze and calculate the overall grade.</p>

                            scale of OET scorecard and the respective grades
                            associated with it.
